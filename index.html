                    <p>
                        Interactive & Audio-Visual communication is a complex undertaking. It is a strong medium for the
                        infusion of ideas among its audience. Quality ultimately depends upon each input and must be
                        ensured at every stage of the process from pre-production to production and also in its post
                        project
                        reporting.We understand the whole process and we are striving hard to promote the noble values
                        of patience, forgiveness,respect of other’s point of view and cultural diversity through theatre
                        and
                        videos.

                    <p>
                        The foundation of our creative approach is content driven. We start our creative process by
                        working with our project partners on multidisciplinary concepts and our content development
                        team first defines the theme, main storylines and messages that are to be conveyed through the
                        interactive & audio-visual communications etc.Then we immerse ourselves in the content,provided
                        either by the partners or by our own research. Only then we have a thorough understanding of
                        what needs to be conveyed.So we start to make decisions about how best to convey it.
                        We develop production paths for all our projects,identifying any unknowns,potential problems and
                        unanswered questions. From the production path, we create detailed production schedule.We
                        recognize that strict adherence to a schedule of completion for each component is a key to stay
                        on
                        budget.
                        We identify the target audience for each message to be conveyed earlier than the content
                        development process to ensure that the communication programs are going to educate and move
                        its audience.
